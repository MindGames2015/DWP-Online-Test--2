DWP Online Test

Hi this is a Java EE Maven project. This compiles but with no output, as it doesn't go into the if statement 
' if (distanceInMiles <= 50.00), and I have tried to figure out why, but with no luck. 
The application uses Geodesic class, which is needed for certain calculations for Latitude/Longitude.

Thanks

Paul Hudson
